# 3D-Minesweeper-Source
 
This is a 3D version of the classic game Minesweeper. I created this game using the Unity Game Engine and C# with basic flood-filling algorithm.
All of the Source Codes can be found in Assets/Scripts

A website version of the game is accessible through this link: https://k12573.github.io/3D-Minesweeper-Web-Demo/

Please open the link using Microsoft Edge, as WebGL (A 3D game renderer does not work great with Chrome!)

Have Fun! :)
